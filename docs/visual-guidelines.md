##VISUAL STYLE

- Fonts: titles use Playfair Display (serif, elegant); body uses Inter (clean sans). Headings and body always follow that pairing.
- Colors: base dark text `#334155`, lighter text `#64748b` and muted `#94a3b8`; gold primary `#d4af37` with light gold `#f4e4bc`; accent purple `#8b5cf6`; backgrounds are light grays `#f8fafc` to `#e2e8f0`; errors `#ef4444`, success `#10b981`, warning `#f59e0b`.
- Buttons: gold background with white/light text; rounded corners; hover shifts to lighter gold; borders use gold for emphasis.
- Backgrounds: frequent soft linear gradients (luxury-gradient) from very light gray to slightly darker gray; occasional gold gradient for highlights; floating blurred gold blobs in corners for depth; glass-effect cards (white at 70% opacity, blur 10px, subtle gold border) plus luxury-shadow (deep drop shadow with thin gold outline).
- Text accents: gold-text gradient for hero titles; uppercase skinny tracking for labels; large Playfair headings with gentle shadows; body text left-aligned inside white cards.
- Motion: fade/slide animations on load; chat bubbles animate in; typing effects on intro titles and paragraphswith per-character reveal; idle prompt chime; animated dots while chat loads; bounce dots for typing indicator.
- Layout vibes: centered columns, generous padding, rounded 2xl cards, lots of white space; nav/menu overlays on top of gradient; modals with soft shadows and white backgrounds.
- Icons/avatars: circular avatar images with gold border; coai-logo used as coach avatar; avatar picker uses round images.
- Gradients and shadows: luxury-shadow used on most cards; glass-effect for chat panels and lists; gold-text and gold-gradient for primary emphasis.
- Quick-reply chips: rounded pills, gold fill with dark text, small bold font.
- Progress bars: thin rounded track with gold fill; step indicators use gold squares or numbers.
- Corporate flow visuals: same gradients and golds; chat looks like coaching chat; confirmation and intro pages use white cards over the gradient with gold borders.
- Landing hero: big gold call-to-action button, rotating journey titles, hover hint list with slide/fade reveals; minimal distractions, center alignment unless explore list is shown.
