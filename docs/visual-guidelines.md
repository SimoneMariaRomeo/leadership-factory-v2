##VISUAL STYLE

- Fonts: titles use Playfair Display (serif, elegant); body uses Inter (clean sans). Headings and body always follow that pairing.
- Colors: strong text `#2f3b50`, soft text `#5f6b7b`, muted `#9aa6b8`; gold primary `#c79d2d` with light gold `#f6e8c8`; accent lavender `#e9e3ff`; backgrounds softly blended from warm cream to cool blue-gray.
- Buttons: gold background with white text; rounded pill; hover lifts; active adds a soft luminous glow; show a tiny spinner + “Loading...” while busy.
- Backgrounds: soft linear gradients plus floating blurred orbs (gold and lavender); glass-effect cards (white 80–85% opacity, gentle gold border) with deep shadow and subtle gold outline.
- Text accents: optional gold-text gradient for hero titles; uppercase skinny tracking for labels; large Playfair headings with gentle shadows; intro paragraphs can use a typewriter reveal for warmth.
- Motion: fade/slide on load; chat bubbles and badges animate in; typing/typewriter effect on hero or intro lines; spinner inside gold buttons during loading; bounce dots for typing indicator when relevant.
- Layout vibes: centered columns, generous padding, rounded 2xl cards, lots of white space; nav/menu overlays on top of gradient; modals with soft shadows and white backgrounds.
- Icons/avatars: circular avatar images with gold border; coai-logo as the main coach avatar; tiny favicon badge can sit on the avatar badge for an extra accent.
- Gradients and shadows: luxury-shadow used on most cards; glass-effect for chat panels and lists; gold-gradient for primary emphasis.
- Quick-reply chips: rounded pills, gold fill with dark text, small bold font.
- Progress bars: thin rounded track with gold fill; step indicators use gold squares or numbers.
- Corporate flow visuals: same gradients and golds; chat-style bubble or badge near the card top uses a white background with gold edge, carrying the coai logo (and small favicon badge).
- Landing hero: minimal and centered; a single glowing gold Start button on the soft gradient/orb backdrop to keep focus.
