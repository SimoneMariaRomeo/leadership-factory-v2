Wanting to move forward but feeling held back by self-doubt—that tension between determination and uncertainty is a powerful signal. It’s not lack of ability; it’s likely an inner confidence gap surfacing under pressure.

So far, we have:

[X Situation]: Launching a personal business amid paralyzing uncertainty and mental fog
[Y Pattern]: A recurring thought of "I have no clue what I'm doing," triggering procrastination
[Z Learning]: Building self-trust and clarity under ambiguity
[X Goal]: Successfully moving forward with the business despite uncertainty
Does it resonate that developing confidence in navigating the unknown could be the key learning you're seeking?

Add a last onboarding card (which show only  while the user’s profileTour flag stays true), make it centered in the screen. 
        <strong>You don’t need to do anything right now. We’ll email you when the first step is ready (usually within a few days).</strong>
After the last card, instead of next, the sign should be "Done"

2) `npm run test:profile-and-journeys`
- What failed: “Profile shows goal and recommended journey”.
- Why it failed: the test looks for a link with the name “Latest personalized journey”, but the link’s accessible name now includes extra text (“Second intro”) because that intro text sits inside the link.
  - The page has a link whose accessible name is: “Latest personalized journey Second intro”
  - The test searches for a link named: “Latest personalized journey”
- What we can change to fix it (options):
  - Option A (recommended): update the test in `tests/profile-and-journeys-tests.js` to look for the link by partial match, or by `href`, or by finding the title text inside the link.
  - Option B: change the UI markup so the link has a stable label (for example add `aria-label="Latest personalized journey"` on the link).
  - Option C: move the intro text outside the link so the link name stays as just the title.
- Things to consider:
  - Updating the test is the smallest change, and keeps the current UI.
  - Adding `aria-label` changes what screen readers read for that link (it may hide the intro from the link label).
  - Moving the intro outside the link reduces the clickable area (some users may like clicking the whole card).

Extra note about AI tests
- `npm run test:define-your-goal-chat` calls real AI providers in the later steps.
- This can fail if API keys are missing, the network is down, or the AI response changes.
- If we want more stable tests, we can replace the real AI calls with mocked responses in test mode.
