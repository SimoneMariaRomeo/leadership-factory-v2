TO FIX 

-) from a user goal to user goals
at the moment each user can have only one goal. Change it to enable having various goals.
Each goal should have an ID, statement (text), and status (active, achieved)

All active goals should be passed to a bot chat (not just the first one: change Current user goal --> Current user goals)

the define-your-goal session should never be passed existing goals


-) edits to my profile
Put the personalized Learning Journey before Your goal
Change Your goal to Your goals
Add a button to add a new goal 
Each goal should have a button to edit it 
Each goal should have a box to mark "Achieved" or Active. Achieved goals are moved to the bottom and crossed

-) `npm run test:profile-and-journeys`
- What failed: “Profile shows goal and recommended journey”.
- Why it failed: the test looks for a link with the name “Latest personalized journey”, but the link’s accessible name now includes extra text (“Second intro”) because that intro text sits inside the link.
  - The page has a link whose accessible name is: “Latest personalized journey Second intro”
  - The test searches for a link named: “Latest personalized journey”
- What we can change to fix it (options):
  - Option A (recommended): update the test in `tests/profile-and-journeys-tests.js` to look for the link by partial match, or by `href`, or by finding the title text inside the link.
  - Option B: change the UI markup so the link has a stable label (for example add `aria-label="Latest personalized journey"` on the link).
  - Option C: move the intro text outside the link so the link name stays as just the title.
- Things to consider:
  - Updating the test is the smallest change, and keeps the current UI.
  - Adding `aria-label` changes what screen readers read for that link (it may hide the intro from the link label).
  - Moving the intro outside the link reduces the clickable area (some users may like clicking the whole card).
